# Cake Stand Generator

I made a tool that can procedurally generate cake stands. Users can control the number, height, radius, and taper level of plates, along with their distance from each other, the height and radius of the base, the radius of the center pole, and the subdivision height, axis, and cap level on all the geometry. Everything will remain quaded!
